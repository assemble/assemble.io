# \{{moment}}

> A helper to master time! Combining the powers of Assemble, Handlebars.js and Moment.js.

The moment.js has plenty of features and these examples are just the tip of the iceberg of what [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/docs/) can do.

As a tip, remember that `\{{moment method=null}}`  means `moment().method()` and `\{{moment somedate method="something"}}` means `moment(somedate).method("something")`. Also, the handlebars syntax does not let you pass some values (like arrays and objects) directly from the tag, so you may need to use the yaml frontmatter to run those.


## Getting started

Install the helper:

```bash
npm i helper-moment --save-dev
```

Now add the helper to Assemble's options:

```js
assemble: {
  options: {
    // Assemble will automatically resolve the path
    helpers: 'helper-moment'
  }
}
```

## Examples

YAML front matter is not required, but we'll use it hear to supply our example data for purposes of demonstration:

```handlebars
---
example: <%= new Date("Sun Jun 30 2011 01:53:23 GMT+0300 (EEST)") %>
exampletextdate: 'Sun, 30 Jun 2012 11:19:15 +0300'

inputformats: ["ddd, DD MMM YYYY HH:mm:ss ZZ", "MMMM YYYY"]

daysadd:
  days: 5
timeago:
  years: 5
duration:
  hours: 2
  minutes: 33}
---

Unix timestamp of now

\{{moment}}
```

Results in:

```
1372599296756
```

### Current time with formatting

```handlebars
\{{moment format="HH:mm:ss"}}
```

Results in:

```
16:34:56
```

### Specific time with formatting

```handlebars
\{{moment example format="HH:mm:ss"}}
```

Results in:

```
01:53:23
```

### Specific unix timestamp with formatting

```handlebars
\{{moment unixtimestamp format="HH:mm:ss"}}
```

Results in:

```
19:17:56
```

### Specific datetime with formatting

```handlebars
\{{moment example format="dddd, DD MMMM YYYY HH:mm:ss ZZ"}}
```

Results in:

```
Sunday, 30 June 2013 01:53:23 +0300
```

## Language support

```handlebars
\{{moment example lang="fi" format="dddd, DD MMMM YYYY HH:mm:ss ZZ"}}
```

Results in:

```
sunnuntai, 30 kesäkuu 2013 01:53:23 +0300
```

Is the added date valid?

```handlebars
\{{moment example isValid=null}}
```

Results in:

```
true
```

### Input as a string, with defined format

```handlebars
\{{moment [exampletextdate,"ddd, DD MMM YYYY HH:mm:ss ZZ"] format="MMMM YYYY"}}
```

Results in:

```
June 2013
```

## Multiple formats

When multiple formats are used, moment.js attempts to use the "correct" one

```handlebars
\{{moment [exampletextdate,formats] format="MMMM YYYY"}}
```

Results in:

```
June 2013
```

### Specific datetime with formatting, converted to UTC

```handlebars
\{{moment example UTC=null format="dddd, DD MMMM YYYY HH:mm:ss ZZ"}}
```

Results in:

```
Saturday, 29 June 2013 22:53:23 +0000
```

### Getters and setters

Example: get week of year, depends on lang (see [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/) documentation for more details)

```handlebars
The week number in Finland is \{{moment example lang="fi" week=null}}
```

Results in:

```
The week number in Finland is 26
```
