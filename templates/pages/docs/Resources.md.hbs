> Starters, boilerplates and companion projects that extend or make it easier to work with Assemble. Some of these are from Assemble's core team, others from the community. "Thank you!" to all the creators of these projects! We really appreciate your support!


Does your project use Assemble? Did you write a blog post about Assemble? Make a video, or create a "community" project based on Assemble? _[Please let us know!](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/issues)_ &nbsp; We'll post a link to it on our docs. Thanks for thinking of us!

### Updates
