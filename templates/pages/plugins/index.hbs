> Plugins extend the core functionality of Assemble.

Plugins are a new feature, but we know they'll play a big part in Assemble's future. We're looking for great plugins to add to our documentation and "contrib" collection, so please [let us know](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/issues/new) if you have something in mind!

If you authored an Assemble plugin, please submit a pull request to add it to this page!
